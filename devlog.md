### Initial Thoughts  
- This project involves creating an interactive program to manage index files using a B-Tree structure.  
- I need to implement commands like `create`, `open`, `insert`, `search`, and others as outlined in the project details.  
- The B-Tree will have a minimal degree of 10 and must be stored in blocks of 512 bytes, using a specific header format.  
- All operations must handle user input errors and operate on the `cs1` and `cs2` machines.

### Plan  
- Begin by setting up the basic structure of the program, focusing on the interactive menu and handling user input.  
- Implement file creation and opening functionality as the first features.  
- Keep development incremental and ill log all updates as I go
