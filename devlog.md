# Development Log

### Initial Thoughts  
- This project involves creating an interactive program to manage index files using a B-Tree structure.  
- I need to implement commands like `create`, `open`, `insert`, `search`, and others as outlined in the project details.  
- The B-Tree will have a minimal degree of 10 and must be stored in blocks of 512 bytes, using a specific header format.  
- All operations must handle user input errors and operate on the `cs1` and `cs2` machines.

### Plan  
- Begin by setting up the basic structure of the program, focusing on the interactive menu and handling user input.  
- Implement file creation and opening functionality as the first features.  
- Keep development incremental and ill log all updates as I go

My thoughts in general:

The requirement to manage index files with only three nodes in memory at a time feels like it could be tricky, so Iâ€™ll need to carefully plan how to handle memory efficiently. Understanding the file structure, particularly with the big-endian byte order, will be important to get right early on. For now, my main focus will be on implementing the create and open commands to establish the foundation for the program.
